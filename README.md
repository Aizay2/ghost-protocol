## School WiFi Guide

### Understanding Your Environment
- **MAC Filtering**: School registers your device's MAC address
- **Network Monitoring**: IT department can track activities
- **Content Filtering**: Certain websites and services blocked
- **Accountability**: Activities tied to your student account

### Safe Usage Pattern

#### For Anonymous Activities:
1. **Activate Ghost Mode**
   - MAC address changes to random value
   - Tor routing starts
   - VPN connects (if configured)
   - Kill switch enables
   - System cleans previous traces

2. **Browse Anonymously**
   - School sees encrypted Tor/VPN traffic only
   - Your real IP and activities are hidden
   - Access blocked educational resources

3. **Return to Normal**
   - **Deactivate Ghost Mode**
   - MAC resets to school-registered address
   - All services stop
   - System cleans current session traces

#### For School Work:
- Use normal connection with registered MAC
- Access school resources and WiFi
- No anonymity features active

### Recommended Workflow
```
School Day:
8:00 AM - Normal MAC ‚Üí Attend classes, use school resources
12:00 PM - Ghost Mode ‚Üí Private research during lunch
1:00 PM - Normal MAC ‚Üí Back to school work
3:00 PM - Ghost Mode ‚Üí Personal browsing after school
4:00 PM - Normal MAC ‚Üí Ready for next school day
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Tor Not Starting
```bash
# Check if Tor is installed
sudo systemctl status tor

# Start Tor manually
sudo systemctl start tor

# Check port 9050
telnet 127.0.0.1 9050
```

#### MAC Address Change Fails
- Ensure you have proper sudo permissions
- Check if network interface name is correct
- Verify macchanger is installed

#### SSH Connection Issues
**Password Authentication Failed:**
- Server may require SSH keys only
- Use "SSH Key" or "Auto" authentication method

**Key Authentication:**
1. Generate SSH key pair in the application
2. Copy public key to server: `ssh-copy-id user@host`
3. Use "SSH Key" authentication method

#### VPN Connection Problems
- Verify OpenVPN config file path is correct
- Check internet connection before connecting
- Ensure you have valid VPN credentials

### Emergency Recovery

#### Reset Everything:
1. Deactivate Ghost Mode
2. Stop all services manually
3. Reset MAC address
4. Restart application

#### Network Reset:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart networking
sudo dhclient -r
sudo dhclient
```
